`restore-point` git tag:  
Commits with this tag seemed to be useful to fall back to when things go awry. Learned that seemingly simple things such as `pod update` can mess up the entire project, making me bogged down for days with troubleshooting. (Not kidding.) Put on the list of priorities to ditch Firebase with a custom backend because Cocoapods seems to break with every update. Or just get rid of Cocoapods?

UI TODO
=======

"Settings" goes to a table view where "Logout" is on the bottom
  + Strive for an adaptive interface such as the iOS "Settings"
    (i.e., on iPhone, it is a tableview, on iPad it is a split view)

"Recordings" goes to a sectioned table view. Sections:
  + "Current status" 
     Shows whether a recording is in progress (u.i., is there an unqueued audio).
  + "Queued"
  + "Submitted"

"Help!" menu(?) to call, email or message Access News.

Show reader statistics -> Settings?

"Submit" uploads all queued recordings, including the current one that is stopped.
It behaves the same way if there are many queued recordings or none: a modal view
pops up, asks for how much time they spent recording and then it sends the file(s)
to firebase.

Tooltips section on each audio control status. For example, when recording is stopped,
it will say that "To resume recording, press Record. To start recording another article,
press Queue and tap Record after that. Or to upload the article right now, hit Submit."
And so on.

On "Submit" and "Queue" -> popup dialog to confirm publication (and optionally, the
title). For example, "Saving Sacramento Bee article (titled blabla). Confirm ChangePublication"

Add titles to scenes - UIViewController's `title` attribute. (recordings, Settings, etc.)

Notes
=====

`GoogleInfo.plist` is added to the repo, because the final
service will run on another account and anyone finding
this app useful should set up their own Firebase project.

TODO
====

* Extend this README with potential use cases (e.g., with trivial
  modification, this could be used as a personal app to upload files/content
  to Google Storage via Firebase)

* Add a license (currently exclusive copyright applies)
